# GROUP- DOBBY - lab 2 - variant 5

Set based on hash-map (collision resolution: open address)
We use Linear detection of open address to collision resolution

## Project structure

- `HashMapImmutable.py` -- implementation of `Node` class for basic Data Structure.
   and `Hashdic` class.
- Include `cons` `remove` `length` `to_list` `from_list` `iterator`
  `member` `find` `mempty` `mconcat` `map` `reduce` and `filter` features.
- `HashMapImmutable_test.py` -- we set all function tests for `HashMapImmutable`.

## Contribution

- Du,Mei(212320038@hdu.edu.cn) -- completed basic operations.
- zhuhaonan(921057454@qq.com) -- fix Bugs and test.
